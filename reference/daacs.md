# Data from the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS)

This is data part of a larger randomized control trial designed to test
the effect of DAACS on student success. These data are from the
treatment group at a large online college. DAACS was embedded within
orientation. Although students were expected to complete orientation
there were no consequences for not doing so. As a result some or all
DAACS data are missing for a large proportion of the students.
